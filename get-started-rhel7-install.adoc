## Step2 Content
This section provides a brief overview of the steps for installing Red Hat Enterprise Linux. Detailed instructions can be found in the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/7/html/Installation_Guide/[Red Hat Enterprise Linux Installation Guide].

There are a few key steps to remember during the installation process:

. You will need to select an _Installation destination_, the disk or partition(s) where the software will be installed. *The disk or partition(s) you select will be overwritten.* Make sure you understand your selection before starting the installation to avoid accidental data loss.
. You should configure networking under _Network and host name_ before starting the installation. You will need access to the Internet to complete registration and download additional software. The network can be configured after the system is installed. However, the steps are more straightforward during installation.
. Select _Server with a GUI_ under _Software Selection_ so the system will boot into the full graphical environment after installation. By default, Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server, will not install a graphical desktop. Using the _server_ product variant of Red Hat Enterprise Linux gives you access to the widest range of software to develop with.
. Create your primary user acccount during installation. After the installation begins, you will be instructed to set a password for the root administrator account and be given the opportunity to create a regular user account. You should create a user before the installation process completes. You shouldn't use the root account as your primary login for development. If you don't create a user before the installation completes, you will need reboot and then login as root to create the user.

### Installation instructions

. Start the system from the bootable disk and select "Install Red hat Enterprise Linux 7".

## Faq section title
[[troubleshooting]]Troubleshooting and FAQ

## Faq section
1. My system is unable to download updates from Red Hat.
+
I don't have a current Red Hat subscription, can I get an evaluation?
+
If you donâ€™t have a Red Hat Enterprise Linux subscription, you can try it for free. Get started with an evaluation at link:https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-enterprise-linux/evaluation[].  Developers should select the Red Hat Enterprise Linux Developer Workstation option to ensure your evaluation includes additional tools from the Red Hat Developer Toolset and Red Hat Software Collections.
+
2. When I start Atomic Host, I don't see a graphical environment.
+
Atomic Host is specifically optimized for the deployment of Linux containers in environments such as Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). It's minimal footprint contains only the software needed to efficiently host containers. Since it does not include a graphical user interface, or development tools, Atomic Host isn't suited for software development activities. Instead, developers should use Red Hat Enterprise Linux which is design to suit many purposes including desktop and server installations. See link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/881893[Get Started with Docker Formatted Container Images on Red Hat Systems]. After an application has been developed and packaged in a container, developers may want to test them on Atomic Host. Atomic Host can be helpful for developers that are creating continuous integration / continuous delivery (CI/CD) environments.
+
3. How do I tell if a container image with a new version of Python is available?
+
How can I see what other container images are available?
+
I can't find the container mentioned in this tutorial, how can I tell if the name changed?
+
To see what other containers are available in the Red Hat container registry, use one or more of the following searches:

[.code-block]
```
# docker search registry.redhat.com/openshift3
# docker search registry.redhat.com/jboss
# docker search registry.redhat.com/rhel
```
+
4. Can I run and build docker containers on Red Hat Enterprise Linux?
